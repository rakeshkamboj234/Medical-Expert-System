Medications are the cornerstone of tuberculosis treatment.

The most common treatment for active TB is isoniazid INH in combination with three other drugs—rifampin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol.

Regimens for treating TB disease have an intensive phase of 2 months, followed by a continuation phase of either 4 or 7 months. The continuation phase should be extended to 28 weeks for patients who have cavitation on the intensive chest film and positive sputum cultures after 2 months of treatment.

Once your course of treatment is finished, you may have tests to make sure you are clear of TB. You might need more treatment if tests show there is still TB bacteria in your body, but most people will get the all-clear. Your treatment will not be stopped until you are cured.

Medication:

Isoniazid (INH): This is the most common therapy for latent TB. You typically take an isoniazid antibiotic pill daily for 9 months.
Rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane): You take this antibiotic each day for 4 months. It’s an option if you have side effects or contraindications to INH.
Isoniazid and rifapentine.
