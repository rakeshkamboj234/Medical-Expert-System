Jaundice is treated by managing the underlying cause.

Treatment depends on the cause of the jaundice, the bilirubin levels, and a baby's age.

Mild jaundice goes away after 1 or 2 weeks as a baby's body gets rid of the extra bilirubin on its own. For newborns with breastfeeding jaundice, mothers should breastfeed the baby more often. If the baby is not getting enough breast milk, the doctor may suggest supplementing with formula.

Medication:

1. Ceftriaxone 
2. Neonates (CEFT)

Treatments:

Fluids. A loss of fluids (dehydration) will cause bilirubin levels to rise.
Phototherapy. Babies lie under lights with little clothing so their skin is exposed.
Exchange blood transfusion.
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg).
